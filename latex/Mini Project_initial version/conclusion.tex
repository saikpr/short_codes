\chapter{Conclusion}

This program was built so as to show one of the varied uses of the file hashing algorithms. 
\\`\\
Theoretically, MD5 provides large enough hash to differentiate two large files. Since the output is limited to fixed size and input is larger than output size using pigeonhole principle it can be seen that there will be cases when different input create the same output hash value. \\In that  case both the files will be deleted. To further  reduce this possibility we had compared the files by there size also which reduce probability of collision drastically making it practically impossible to occur.
