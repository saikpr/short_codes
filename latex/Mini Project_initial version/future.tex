This program has wide uses as multiple instances of file on the same local storage media are unwanted. The software can be developed further so as to automatically check for corrupt duplicates and remove them. Duplicate files can cause decrease in storage space and also reduce the life of the storage media.  Besides, it also becomes a very tedious job to back up data containing lot of duplicates as it takes unnecessary time which increases multiple times.
