\chapter{Application}
The hashing algorithm can be used in various cases.
\\~\\
One can compare integrity of files using this algorithm. 
File duplicity can be removed comparing hash values.
\\~\\
Certain related content about the files can be easily and efficiently searched online by simply passing the hash value as search argument.
\\~\\
Hashing has also been used in cryptography in order to prevent unnecessary access and deciphering of sensitive data.
\\~\\
Security can be increased efficiently by comparing a large dataâ€™s hash key to the another data hash key and using the data as passwords. If the hash values of data do not match then no need of comparing the data.
