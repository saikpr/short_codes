\chapter{Future Prospects}
This program has wide uses as multiple instances of file on the same local storage media are unwanted. The software can be developed further so as to automatically check for corrupt duplicates and remove them. Duplicate files can cause decrease in storage space and also reduce the life of the storage media.  Besides, it also becomes a very tedious job to back up data containing lot of duplicates as it takes unnecessary time which increases multiple times.

Another way to use the program would be to modify it and check has values of two instances of data so as to check integrity of a file copied from some source. This can help in reliability of copied data and it can also be used to avoid unnecessary copying of data.

The file comparison algorithm uses the hashing of complete files so it removes only those files that are exact copies of each other. However at certain situations we use certain files that are copies of one original file but are not of same quality as original files. i.e they are reduced quality versions of the same files.  To compare such files another algorithm which compare data on the basis of content similarity can be used. \\~\\
ID3 tags in mp3 files can be used to compare mp3 compressed files of different bitrates. Also certain cases in which another media file which is a reduced quality of some other file can be removed using comparison mechanism.
