Some of the Benefits of clustering are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low Cost: Customers can eliminate the cost and complexity of procuring, configuring and operating HPC clusters with low, pay-as-you-go pricing. Further, you can optimize costs by leveraging one of several pricing models: On Demand, Reserved or Spot Instances.

\item Elasticity: You can add and remove computer resources to meet the size and time requirements for your workloads.

\item Run Jobs Anytime, Anywhere: You can launch compute jobs using simple APIs or management tools and automate workflows for maximum efficiency and scalability. You can increase your speed of innovation by accessing computer resources in minutes instead of spending time in queues.
\end{itemize}
