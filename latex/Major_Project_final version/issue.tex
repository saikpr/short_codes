\chapter{Issues and Challenges}
Issues addressed in the program are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes a delay in passing the scripts was observed which could be a result of increased latency.
\item The Error handling of the script to be run should be done properly to prevent the program from stoping in middle.
\item For more interactive use a graphical user interface was installed and used, but as it turns out it was more complex than the CUI itself.

\end{itemize}
