\chapter{Conclusion}

SGE was implemeted on 2 VirtualBox Vms.

100 task, (which sleep for 10secs and then print time, to a file and then exits ) where run on this job scheduler cluster.
It took almost 510 sec total to run all the task. 

It was observed that if we install and scripting language on one node and limit that language to that node only then SGE was forwarding task to that node onnly which was one of our basic requirment to reduce the cost of buying proprietary languages, as matlab.
